                    Front End Developer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I've worked as a solo developer and with a team of developers, designers, copywriters, and project managers.
                    I've worked in office and currently work from home for a remote company. 
                    No matter the environment, I love helping people get their ideas connected and being part of that process.

                <p>
                    I'm a proud Kansan who's been coding for roughly 5 years. 
                    I have bachelor's degree from Kansas State and work as a front-end contractor for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.productiveedge.com/">Productive Edge</a>.
                    Most of my experience is in Front End and in Web Development,
                    but I've had plenty of experience in school with Visual Studio apps, SQL apps, and console apps.
                    I'm most comfortable in JavaScript but was taught in Java and C# and am excited to return to those as well as get more comfortable with python and different flavors of SQL.
                    My main hobbies include creating side projects to keep practicing my software skills as well as playing rugby for the <a target="_blank" href="https://kcblues.org/">KC Blues.</a>

                <p>
                    <br>
                    I have a bachelor's in Computer Science as well as attended a year long Web Developer course from <a target="_blank" href="https://bottega.tech/">Bottega Tech</a>.
                    Bottega mostly taught front end development with a focus on React Devlopment including state management and redux.
                    It also had decent sized sections on UML and PostgreSQL.
                    <br><br>
                    K-State was a more holistic education, with a focus on Object Oriented Programming using Java and C# in Visual Studio.
                    It also largely focused on Data Structures and Logic, such as a Data Structures and Algorithms class, graph theory, proving theorems, and general logic classes.
                    A huge part of the education was understanding that all languages and frameworks ultimately can be used to solve the same problems,
                    and a good developer can use whichever tools best fits a job. Skills should be transferable from project to project.
